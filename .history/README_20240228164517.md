# Connect-Four-Modeling
Modeling the chess game "connect four" using formal method

## Project Objective

Connect Four is a fun game for two players. The goal is to be the first to line up four of your own colored discs in a row. Picture a vertical grid with six rows and seven columnsâ€”it's like a standing frame. Players take turns dropping their colored discs into any column, and the disc falls down to the lowest empty spot. The winner is the first person to get four of their discs in a row, whether it's up and down, side to side, or diagonally.
